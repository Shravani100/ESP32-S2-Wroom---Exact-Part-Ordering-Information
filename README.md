# ESP32-S2-Wroom---Exact-Part-Ordering-Information
Hi! I want to order the ESP32 S2 Wroom, from Mouser. On Mouser, under the same name we can find two products listed. 1.) 356-ESP32S2WRM320PS3 and 2.) 356-ESP32S2WRM3200PH. The datasheet for both part numbers is same. How do I distinguish between them, and how do I decide what to order? 
Please find product links to both on Mouser:
1.) 356-ESP32S2WRM320PS3
